# Affirmation

Affirmation is a solution is designed for transmitting possitive affirmations to people nearby. With recent breakthroughs in computing, some expert users have the ability to hold their laptops aloft and face them toward a distant person, allowing the transmission of positive messages through Eye-To-Screen technology. 

Affirmation was created out of necessity. When viewing presentations in a noise-controlled environment which did not allow for applause, affirmation was made as a way to send positive vibes without clapping.
